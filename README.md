# 🌐 API Practical Codes

A collection of Python-based **API practical assignments** developed as part of my **B.Tech (Computer Science & Engineering)** coursework.  
This repository represents a compilation of lab exercises and mini-projects focusing on **RESTful API development**, **integration**, and **testing** using Python frameworks such as **Flask** and **Django**.

Each practical demonstrates real-world backend development concepts and is designed to strengthen understanding of how APIs interact within web applications.

## 🧠 Overview

This repository serves as a learning-oriented project that explores how APIs function at both client and server ends.  
The practicals cover everything from **building RESTful APIs** and **handling HTTP requests** to **implementing authentication**, **connecting with databases**, and **testing endpoints** using Postman.

It aims to bridge the gap between theoretical API knowledge and hands-on software development skills required in modern web engineering.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Flask / Django** — for building APIs
- **Requests** — for consuming external APIs
- **JSON** — for structured data exchange
- **Postman** — for API testing and documentation

## 🚀 How to Run the Practicals

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vicky9022/API_Practical_Code.git
Navigate to the project directory

bash
Copy code
cd API_Practical_Code
Open a specific practical folder

bash
Copy code
cd AssignmentNoX
(Replace X with the assignment number you want to execute)

Run the Python file

bash
Copy code
python app.py
or

bash
Copy code
python main.py
